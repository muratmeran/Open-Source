More explanation:
Too many features are not working for this level, it was only a trial (a proof of concept) for the idea.
You can host the files on your own server and for yourself, and you can also serve people by hosting it for public.

This version was developed during N2V Hackathon competition 25th Jun. 2011.

* This is OPEN SOURCE, you are allowed to take the code, develop it, or even make an advanced version for commercial uses.

For now, there is no tutorial for how to use this, and some files were only for testing purposes, so please contact me for mechanism's explanations.
